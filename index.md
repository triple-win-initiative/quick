## The potential "triple win" of high-quality childcare 

In Kenya’s low-income urban communities, access to high-quality childcare has the potential to transform women’s economic agency and children’s development. Yet for many families, safe and reliable childcare is still out of reach. Nearly **one in three female business owners brings a young child to work**, a practice associated with a nearly 50% reduction in profits—limiting their earnings, productivity, and growth potential.

Access to high-quality childcare has the potential to yield three big "wins"

- Parents: greater earnings and economic empowerment
- Children: improved nutrition and development
- Providers: increased business stability, profitability, and empowerment

## An innovative partnership

Working alongside IPA Kenya and a local social enterprise, we are testing a pioneering approach to building a stronger childcare market from the ground up. The initiative provides continuous support to daycare providers, combining business training, caregiving practices, access to nutrition services, facility improvements, and ongoing mentorship. The model aims to make high-quality childcare both sustainable and accessible—while enabling mothers to enter and stay in the workforce.

## A large-scale randomized evaluation



The study includes **1,000 childcare providers** across **51 communities** in 11 Kenyan counties that care for children under age three. Communities were **randomly assigned** to receive the program or to serve as comparison sites, making it possible to rigorously measure causal impacts on:

- Childcare quality and safety
- Financial sustainability of daycare firms
- Market structure and pricing
- Mothers’ employment and labor supply

Surveys with more than **3,000 parents** will help determine whether improving childcare quality leads to higher enrollment and enables women to pursue income-generating work.

## Why it matters

Improving childcare is not just about early learning—it is a market-level intervention with the potential to reshape women’s economic opportunities. By testing a scalable and locally rooted model, this project has the potential to inform childcare policy and systems design across Kenya—and beyond.

**Results are anticipated in 2026.**
