Associate Professor of Development Economics at The Ohio State University's Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics. I was awarded a dual Ph.D. in Economics and Public Policy from the University of Michigan in 2015. My  research  focuses on health and education in developing countries, particularly issues affecting women and children. I specialize in conducting randomized evaluations aimed at testing policies to improve health care and education quality, with the ultimate goal of improving the well-being of individuals worldwide. I also have  ongoing research projects studying the financial impacts of large-scale health insurance expansions in the US with my sister Katie and an exciting agenda focused on the childcare sector.
