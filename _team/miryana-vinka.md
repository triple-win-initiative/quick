Welcome! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Agricultural, Environmental, and Development Economics at Ohio State University. My research focuses on development economics and economic demography, with a particular emphasis on women and children.

I hold an MS in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a BA in Economics from Universitas Indonesia.

In my free time, I enjoy doing Lagree, going for walks, and watching movies.
