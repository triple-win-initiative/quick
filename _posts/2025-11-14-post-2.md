description: "Imagine a maternal health program operating in rural Kenya. Funders want to know: 'What's the cost per life saved?' The implementing team is asking: 'How much will it cost to scale this to three more districts?' Meanwhile, the monitoring team needs to know: 'Are we spending our budget efficiently compared to similar programs?' Same program, three different questions—and each requires a fundamentally different costing approach."

In education, their evaluation of Speed Schools showed that accelerated learning programs could successfully reintegrate out-of-school children back into the formal system, crucial evidence for a region where conflict and poverty often disrupt schooling.

In healthcare, one of their evaluations demonstrated that removing cost barriers for caregivers dramatically increases timely medical care—evidence that influenced health financing approaches across West Africa. Finally, their work on women's savings groups provided concrete proof that these programs boost food security and asset ownership, informing regional strategies for women's economic empowerment.

## Closing a Chapter

After years of groundbreaking research and policy work, the office is closing, but its legacy continues to influence research and policy far beyond Mali’s borders. At its peak, the IPA Mali team included 20 permanent local staff who tackled research challenges across agriculture, education, health, governance, and peace-building and established collaborative relationships between IPA and partners that produced years of impactful research.

Perhaps the most lasting contribution is the human capital the office developed. IPA Mali became a launching pad for careers across the development sector. The office trained dozens of research associates and managers from Mali and beyond, many of whom have gone on to remarkable achievements.

But it wasn't just the permanent staff. Hundreds—perhaps thousands—of enumerators learned cutting-edge research and data collection methods through IPA Mali's projects. That training created a ripple effect, as these skilled researchers went on to work with other organizations across the country and region, spreading methodological rigor wherever they landed.

The innovations born from Mali's challenging environment didn't stay local either. The digital data collection methods pioneered in Mali have become standard across the organization and many of the lessons learned there continue shaping how the organization approaches difficult environments worldwide.

Above all, we are deeply grateful to the dedicated staff who built and sustained the Mali office over the years. Their professionalism and perseverance under challenging circumstances made every achievement possible. We also appreciate the collaboration of our donors, partners, and researchers and will continue our collaborations with local organizations. The office’s legacy is carried not only in the research and innovations it produced, but also in the many individuals who contributed their time, talent, and passion—a legacy that will continue shaping IPA and the broader development community.
